--  base type for refcounted types (mainly event streams). all streams and
--  some other objects can be used with reference-counting smart pointers, so
--  this base type implements the reference counting. note that this type
--  does not have any stream semantic; that is to be implemented by child
--  types by providing a Stream_Concept instance (if they are streams).
   --
--  beware that this type is only the vessel for the reference count and does
--  not do any reference counting itself; the reference-counting management
--  functions must be called from a smart pointer type. An object of a child
--  type can be used on the stack, in which case the reference count is not
--  used and instead the object just goes out of scope.
